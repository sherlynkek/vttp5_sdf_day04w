# Objective
The objective of this workshop is to write a client/server fortune cookie

# Setup
a. Create a repository in Github
b. Clone the repository

# Workshop
## Task 1
Write a fortune cookie server that will serve random cookie. The server is started as follows

    java -cp fortunecookie.jar fc.Server 12345 cookie_file.txt

This will start the server; the server will now listen on port 12345 (TCP). cookie_file.txt is a file containing a list of 'cookies'. This is a text file. The server will randomly return one cookie from this file.

## Task 2
Write a seperate class, *Cookie*, to manage the cookie file. All interactions with cookie should g othrough an instance of this class. Examples of interaction include open and closing the cookie file and randomly return a cookie text.

## Task 3
Write a fortune cookie client whar will make a request to a fortune cookie server to get a cookie. The client is started as follows

    java -cp fortunecookie.jar fc.Client locahost : 12345

The server for the client to connect to is in the form of <'host>:<'port>.
The client will request a cookie from the server, displays the cookie and closes the connection.

## Task 4
The communication between the client and the server is hown in the following diagram


The above diagram shows the interaction between the client and the server. After the client connects to the server the client will send a *get-cookie* command to the server.

When the server receives the *get-cookie*, it will randomly select a cookie text from the cookie file. The cookie text will then be send back to the client. The cookie text will be prefixed with the command *cookie-text*.

Once the client receives the cookie-text command, the client will strip the *cookie-text* prefix and displays the cookie in the console.

The client can optionally get more cookies (by sending *get-cookie* command) or closes the connection with a *close* command.

Command summary
- *get-cookie* - send by client to server; request the server to send a cookie
- *cookie-text* - send by server to client in respond to get a *get-cookie* *cookie-text* is used to return a cookie to a client. The cookie text comes after the *cookie-text* command
- *close* - send by client to server; request the server to close the connection
